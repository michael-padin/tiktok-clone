# Tiktok Clone

<p align="left">Sanity, Next JS, zustand for global state, and tailwind CSS were used to build this as a personal project. I'm able to optimized the app using react hooks like Memoization, Lazyloading, etc. Why I chose sanity for backend, because sanity is fast, easy to setup, customize, and scale data. Any errors or problems that come up while constructing this project can be fixed by me. I learned a lot from this project, and it improved my problem-solving skills.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
